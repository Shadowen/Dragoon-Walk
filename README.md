Dragoon-Walk is named after the infamous pathfinding behaviour of the Dragoon from StarCraft: Brood War. It performs a long random walk in 2-dimensional space and draws the frequency histogram of steps it arrived on the screen, creating a unique effect. Each pixel's colour is specified by RGBA values generated based on the frequency of hits on the pixel.
